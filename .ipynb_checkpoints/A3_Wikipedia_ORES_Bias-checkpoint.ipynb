If you're curious, you can [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Content_assessment#Grades) about what these assessment classes mean on English Wikipedia. For this assignment, you only need to know that these categories exist, and that ORES will assign one of these six categories to any `rev_id`. You need to extract all `rev_id`s in the `page_data.csv` file and use the ORES API to get the predicted quality score for that specific article revision."
